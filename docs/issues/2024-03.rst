LLMs
----
`SWARMBRAIN: EMBODIED AGENT FOR REAL-TIME STRATEGY GAME STARCRAFT II VIA LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17749.pdf>`_
    LLMs play SC2.  Two stage model: (1) is an "Overmind" where multiple LLMs are blended together to create macro strategy in the same way the Zerg are supposed to function and (2) a "Swarm ReflexNet" which controls individual units.  Cool way of setting up an agent, and can beat the SC2 computer set to "Hard" model 76% of the time.  I'm not sure how impressive that is.  

`LLMs learn governing principles of dynamical systems, revealing an in-context neural scaling law <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00795.pdf>`_
    LLMs can, when given a time series representing some physical thing generated by a dynamical system (e.g. double pendulum), learn the underlying physical dynamics well enough to predict the future of the time series.  I'm kind of unclear on how much "learning underlying principles" vs "predicting future of time series" is going on here.

`POKELLMON: A Human-Parity Agent for Pokemon Battles with Large Language Models <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01118.pdf>`_
    LLMs play Pokemon Showdown.  Has a couple of techniques to bring in outside knowledge to keep the LLM in line.  Gets about a 50% winrate on the pokemon showdown ladder.  Given that pokemon showdown uses ELO this is going to be expected unless its either the worst or best player online - the actual ELO values is more important.

`SELF-DISCOVER: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03620.pdf>`_
    Deepmind.  Proposes SELF-DISCOVER, a method to get LLMs to reason which outperforms Chain-of-Thought.  For a given task, it first proposes a reasoning structure appropriate to that task and then uses the structure to solve the task.  Performs best on tasks requiring world knowledge instead of algorithmic tasks such as MATH.  Might be something we can implement.

Build It

Theory
------
`Understanding Adam Optimizer via Online Learning of Updates: Adam is FTRL in Disguise <2402.01567.pdf (arxiv.org)>`_
    Recasts optimizers as online learners and finds that " Adam corresponds to a principled online learning framework called Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)."  This paper is worth reading if you want to understand how Adam works.

Images
------


Doctrinaire
-----------
`Shrub of a thousand faces: an individual segmentation from satellite images using deep learning <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17985.pdf>`_
    Doctrinaire frooom spaaaace but for shrubs.  Somehow they have better quality data for shrubs than we have for MAGI?  Integrates on the ground data and spatial data, seems to develop its own architecture for detecting/segmenting juniper shrubs.  

`Tiered approach for rapid damage characterisation of infrastructure enabled by remote sensing and deep learning technologies <https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2401/2401.17759.pdf>`_
    Assess infrastructure damage from space using a three-tiered approach.  Applied to a case study in Ukraine.  Seems like a direction we could take MAGI in if there's interest.

`ON THE MODELLING OF SHIP WAKES IN S-BAND SAR IMAGES AND AN APPLICATION TO SHIP IDENTIFICATION <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04066.pdf>`_
    Develops a simulator for S-Band SAR data to simulate ships wakes.  Train a deep learning model on this data for ship classification.  The synthetic to real data pipeline somewhat indicates that this is something that we could implement, whether in this setting or a different one. 

Reasoning

Knowledge Graphs

Fusion
------
`INTERPRETABLE MULTI-SOURCE DATA FUSION THROUGH LATENT VARIABLE GAUSSIAN PROCESS <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04146.pdf>`_
    GE Aeorspace Research presents a frameowrk for multi-source data fusion using latent variable Gaussian Processes.  They show off a bit on simulated examples and on "Thermal Aging Behavior of FeCrAl Alloys" and "Magnetic Behavior of SmCoFe Alloys".  Seems somewhat regression based - not sure how to apply to our work but seems cool.   

Stats
-----
`Diffusive Gibbs Sampling <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03008.pdf>`_
    Gibbs sampling often has trouble with bimodal (or multimodal) posterior distributions.  Diffusive Gibbs sampling gets around this by leveraging stuff from diffusion models: "auxiliary noisy distribution that bridges isolated modes in the original space and applying Gibbs sampling to alternately draw samples from both spaces"

`IMPROVED PREDICTION OF FUTURE USER ACTIVITY IN ONLINE A/B TESTING <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03231.pdf>`_
    Develops a novel Bayesian nonparametric method to estimate quantity of new customers and number of times they will be observed in A/B testing environments.  Inference is done via empirical Bayes.  Appears to outperform competitors.
    
Datasets
---------
`Vehicle Perception from Satellite <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00703.pdf>`_
    New dataset for vehicle detection from satellites just dropped.  408 videos with 9296 images for a total of 128,801 vehicles.  

Applications
---------

`Estimating individual contributions to team success in women’s college volleyball <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01083.pdf>`_
    Models individual performance in the 2022 NCAA womens basketball season using a Markov Chain to simulate the progression of a game and a generalized linear mixed effects model to model individual contributions.  Seems to be a step forward for the field. 

Position Papers
---------------
`Position Paper: Bayesian Deep Learning in the Age of Large-Scale AI <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00809.pdf>`_
    20(ish) authors, including Yee Whye Teh, think that Bayesian deep learning has great potential to solve a diverse array of problems, particularly in combination with foundation models.  Seems more like a "work needs to be done, but if its done there's a lot of potential" than "this is ready to go off the shelf".  Worth keeping an eye on the field.

`Mission Critical – Satellite Data is a Distinct Modality in Machine Learning <Mission Critical – Satellite Data is a Distinct Modality in Machine Learning (arxiv.org)>`_
    Position paper with some names from big universities/companies arguing that satellite data is a domain unto itself deserving of its own techniques and methods.  This tracks with what we've been doing on MAGI, but maybe points to growing interest from academia/industry

`A Virtual Solar Wind Monitor for Mars with Uncertainty Quantification using Gaussian Processes <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01932.pdf>`_
    Uses Gaussian Process Regression to esitmate solar winds from the MAVEN mission.  Sparse spatiotemporal data.  Not exactly a novel method, but a cool application.
