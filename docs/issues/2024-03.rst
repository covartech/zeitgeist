LLMs
----
`SWARMBRAIN: EMBODIED AGENT FOR REAL-TIME STRATEGY GAME STARCRAFT II VIA LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17749.pdf>`_
    LLMs play SC2.  Two stage model: (1) is an "Overmind" where multiple LLMs are blended together to create macro strategy in the same way the Zerg are supposed to function and (2) a "Swarm ReflexNet" which controls individual units.  Cool way of setting up an agent, and can beat the SC2 computer set to "Hard" model 76% of the time.  I'm not sure how impressive that is.  

`LLMs learn governing principles of dynamical systems, revealing an in-context neural scaling law <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00795.pdf>`_
    LLMs can, when given a time series representing some physical thing generated by a dynamical system (e.g. double pendulum), learn the underlying physical dynamics well enough to predict the future of the time series.  I'm kind of unclear on how much "learning underlying principles" vs "predicting future of time series" is going on here.

Theory

`Position Paper: Bayesian Deep Learning in the Age of Large-Scale AI <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00809.pdf>`_
    20(ish) authors, including Yee Whye Teh, think that Bayesian deep learning has great potential to solve a diverse array of problems, particularly in combination with foundation models.  Seems more like a "work needs to be done, but if its done there's a lot of potential" than "this is ready to go off the shelf".  Worth keeping an eye on the field.


Images

Doctrinaire
-----------
`Shrub of a thousand faces: an individual segmentation from satellite images using deep learning <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17985.pdf>`_
    Doctrinaire frooom spaaaace but for shrubs.  Somehow they have better quality data for shrubs than we have for MAGI?  Integrates on the ground data and spatial data, seems to develop its own architecture for detecting/segmenting juniper shrubs.  

`Tiered approach for rapid damage characterisation of infrastructure enabled by remote sensing and deep learning technologies <https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2401/2401.17759.pdf>`_
    Assess infrastructure damage from space using a three-tiered approach.  Applied to a case study in Ukraine.  Seems like a direction we could take MAGI in if there's interest.

    New dataset for vehicle detection from satellites just dropped.  408 videos with 9296 images for a total of 128,801 vehicles.
