`MART: MultiscAle Relational Transformer Networks for Multi-agent Trajectory Prediction <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21635>`_
    Uses relation transformers to do multi-agent tracking in basketball data.  This kind of makes sense since tracking involves sequences and transformers are good at that.

`Large Language Monkeys: Scaling Inference Compute with Repeated Sampling <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21787>`_
    Generating accurate answers is hard, but verifying an answer is (sometimes) easy.  If you are living in a world where verifying an answer is easy, you can have an LLM generate a ton of answers and find th correct one.  Greatly improves performance.
