LLMs
----
`Towards General Computer Control: A Multimodal Agent for Red Dead Redemption II as a Case Study <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03186.pdf>`_
    LLM plays Red Dead Redemption II.  Takes compuer screen and audio as inputs, and outputes keyboard/mouse actions, like a human would.  Something like this might be a good way to mimic what a human does in other areas?

`Artifacts or Abduction: How Do LLMs Answer Multiple-Choice Questions Without the Question? <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12483.pdf>`_
    LLMs are really good at multiple choice questions.  How good are they are multiplce choice if they just get the answers, and not the questions?  Really good as it turns out.  Overtrained to the training data, or picking up some weird underlying structure?

`Enhancing Court View Generation with Knowledge Injection and Guidance <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04366.pdf>`_
    Have you ever wanted an LLM to be a judge in a court case?  This paper injects legal knowledge into pretrained GPT 2 using some sort of encoder to try to do this.  They outperform the metrics, but I wouldn't trust thsi.

Autonomy
--------
`Toward Autonomous Cooperation in Heterogeneous Nanosatellite Constellations Using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00692.pdf>`_
    How to coordinate EO satellites to observe enough stuff using dynamic graph neural nets.  More constrained, but similar to drone swarm type problems.

`Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Skip Connections for Modeling and Control of Gas-Lifted Oil Wells <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02289.pdf>`_
    Physics-informed neural networks for modelling ODEs/PDEs and controlling dynamic systems like oil wells.  They say introducing skip connections helps improve performance which feels right but also maybe like an old result?

`Reaching Consensus in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Goal Imagination <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03172.pdf>`_
    From Tencent.  A problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning is coordination - this paper attempts to solve that problem by imaging a common goal and guiding agents to that path.  

Theory
------

Doctrinaire
-----------
`Point2Building: Reconstructing Buildings from Airborne LiDAR Point Clouds <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02136.pdf>`_
    Makes a method to autoregressivly 3D meshes from LiDAR point clouds of buildings.  Can probably be adapted to things like tanks?

`LDSF: Lightweight Dual-Stream Framework for SAR Target Recognition by Coupling Local Electromagnetic Scattering Features and Global Visual Features <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03527.pdf>`_
    A Chinese lab from the "National University of Defense Technology" implements a method for incorproating physrics (EM backscattering) into algorithms for ATR with SAR data.  Demonstrates method on MSTAR.  Worth a look, if only to see what the other guy's up to.  

Knowledge Graphs
----------------

Data Labelling
--------------
`Active Statistical Inference <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03208.pdf>`_
    Active learning for choosing which datapoints to label next.  Could be useful for situations where we have many more datapoints than labels (e.g. MAGI)

Stats
-----
`Hierarchical Bayesian Models to Mitigate Systematic Disparities in Prediction with Proxy Outcomes <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00639.pdf>`_
    Andrew Gelman is a co-author.  Deals with label bias - e.g. you're given a diagnosis and not the underlying condition, and this is confounded with other stuff.  Seems relevant for P(object|detection) sort of problems?

`Scalable Bayesian inference for the generalized linear mixed model <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03007.pdf>`_
    Stochastic gradient descent MCMC for Bayesian GLMMs.  Significantly faster than Gibbs sampling, but not compared to frequentist methods.

`PLANT-CAPTURE METHODS FOR ESTIMATING POPULATION SIZE FROM UNCERTAIN PLANT CAPTURES <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04058.pdf>`_
    Develops methods for counting how large a population is based on a capture-recapture model.  Cool stats, lots of applications.

Applications
---------
`Equipment Health Assessment: Time Series Analysis for Wind Turbine Performance <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00975.pdf>`_
    Model wind-turbine perfromance over time using ensembles of FNN and LSTMs.  Each wind turbine is unique enough to require tailoring at the individual level.   

`Estimating the household secondary attack rate with the Incomplete Chain Binomial model <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03948.pdf>`_
    Discrete-time SIR model for infectious diseases, but explicitly modelling the spread within each household  using an Incomplete Chain Binomial model.  I'd never heard of that before and it's nice to learn things.
