Autonomy

`Toward Autonomous Cooperation in Heterogeneous Nanosatellite Constellations Using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00692.pdf>`_
    How to coordinate EO satellites to observe enough stuff using dynamic graph neural nets.  More constrained, but similar to drone swarm type problems.

`Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Skip Connections for Modeling and Control of Gas-Lifted Oil Wells <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02289.pdf>`_
    Physics-informed neural networks for modelling ODEs/PDEs and controlling dynamic systems like oil wells.  They say introducing skip connections helps improve performance which feels right but also maybe like an old result?

Theory

Doctrinaire
-----------
`Point2Building: Reconstructing Buildings from Airborne LiDAR Point Clouds <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02136.pdf>`_
    Makes a method to autoregressivly 3D meshes from LiDAR point clouds of buildings.  Can probably be adapted to things like tanks?

Stats

`Hierarchical Bayesian Models to Mitigate Systematic Disparities in Prediction with Proxy Outcomes <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00639.pdf>`_
    Andrew Gelman is a co-author.  Deals with label bias - e.g. you're given a diagnosis and not the underlying condition, and this is confounded with other stuff.  Seems relevant for P(object|detection) sort of problems?

Applications
---------
`Equipment Health Assessment: Time Series Analysis for Wind Turbine Performance <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00975.pdf>`_
    Model wind-turbine perfromance over time using ensembles of FNN and LSTMs.  Each wind turbine is unique enough to require tailoring at the individual level.
