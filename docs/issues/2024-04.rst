`Toward Autonomous Cooperation in Heterogeneous Nanosatellite Constellations Using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00692.pdf>`_
    How to coordinate EO satellites to observe enough stuff using dynamic graph neural nets.  More constrained, but similar to drone swarm type problems.

    Andrew Gelman is a co-author.  Deals with label bias - e.g. you're given a diagnosis and not the underlying condition, and this is confounded with other stuff.  Seems relevant for P(object|detection) sort of problems?
