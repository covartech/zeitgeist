The CoVar Zeitgeist: June, 2025
================================
A larger than normal amount of interesting papers published this month.  Featuring:

* A method to combine Depth Anything with any sort of absolute depth information to string together absolute depth estimates from monocular imagery.
* A paper from MIT that applies a thermodynamic-based approach to understanding LLM/neural net training.  Finds a river-valley loss landscape and uses that to guide training methods.
* Current approaches towards AI agency focus are focused on empowerment - the ability of an AI agent to influence the future - but Google Deepmind thinks plasticity - the agent's ability to learn from its past - is equally important.  Unfortunately, there's a tension between these concepts.
* Applying RL techniques to LLMs only updates a sparse subset of weights.  RLing only on this sparse subset of weights achieves 99% of RLing the entire model.  
* Proposes Bonsai, a tree-based alternative to UMAP and t-SNE for representing high-dimensional data.  Developed for omics data, it generalizes at least to football data.
* Google Brain develops a novel RL method using video prediction methods to train models to play Atari.

--------
`Depth Anything with Any Prior <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10565>`_
    Develops a method to combine relative depth maps with depth priors that provide absolute depth information to produce accurate absolute depth estimates from monocular imagery.
    
`Neural Thermodynamic Laws for Large Language Model Training <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10559>`_
    Introduces a novel framework, neural thermodynamic laws, which characterize the LLM training process using analogies to thermodynamics.  Posits the existence of a river-valley loss landscape, and uses this to recommend training processes.
    
`Plasticity as the Mirror of Empowerment <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10361>`_
    Agents have been measured by empowerment: their ability to influence the future.  Equally important, this paper argues, is their plasticity: their ability to be influenced by the past.  This paper identifies and proves that there is a tension between these two foundational abilities.

`Reinforcement Learning Finetunes Small Subnetworks in Large Language Models <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11711>`_
    A deep dive into the behavior of various reinforcement learning algorithms on improving LLM performance.  Finds that each method of RL updates only a sparse subset of weights; moreover, training only on that sparse subset of weights achieves the same effect as training on the entire network.
    
`Bonsai: Tree representations for distortion-free visualization and exploratory analysis of single-cell omics data <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.08.652944v1.full.pdf>`_
    Proposes Bonsai, an alternative method to t-SNE and UMAP for representing latent structure in high dimensional data.  Bonsai reconstructs a tree relating the high-dimensional data and, among a number of other improvements, is wholly deterministic. 

`Model Based Reinforcement Learning for Atari <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00374>`_
    Trains a policy by acting in a world model which performs next-frame and reward prediction. The world model is trained with interaction data from the policy acting in the real environment.

LLMs
----
`Large Language Models Are More Persuasive Than Incentivized Human Persuaders <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09662>`_
    Conducts a study to test the effectiveness of AI as a persuader compared to a human.  Found that AI persuaders are more persuasive even when humans are incentivized by economic means.

`Circuit Tracing: Revealing Computational Graphs in Language Models <https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html#global-weights>`_
    Proposes novel algorithms for divining the underlying behavior of LLMs, and develops a large number of analytic tools to enable such analysis.  In a companion paper, applies these methods to Claude 3.5

`Harnessing the Universal Geometry of Embeddings <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12540>`_
    Posits that text embeddings have a universal structure - following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis - and shows this by constructing a method to map text embeddings from different models onto each other without leveraging any paired data or any encoders.  Demonstrates robustness to out-of-distribution data.

`Position: Mechanistic Interpretability Should Prioritize Feature Consistency in SAEs <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20254>`_
    Sparse Autoencoders are potentially useful for finding interpretable features in neural networks, but can be unreliable in that they can produce sets of features.  This paper proposes a metric which prioritizes consistency, and argues that applications following this metric learn consistent semantic features corresponding to ground truth.

LLM Reasoning
-------------
`Language Agents Mirror Human Causal Reasoning Biases. How Can We Help Them Think Like Scientists? <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09614>`_
    Deploys the Blicket test to assess patterns of though in LLMs.  Finds that LLMs perform well at discovering disjunctive causal relationships, but fail to discover conjunctive ones.

`The Coverage Principle: A Framework for Understanding Compositional Generalization <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20278>`_
    Notes that LLMs that rely solely on pattern matching struggle to generalize in compositional tasks, and leverages this observation to provide a coverage-based metric for LLM reasoning performance.  Finds that there are three ways in which neural networks can generalize: structure-based, property-based, and shared-operator.

`The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Entropy Minimization in LLM Reasoning <https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15134>`_
    If a model is capable, it is likely to be correct when it is confident.  This paper uses entropy minimization to leverage this insight and force the model to place more probability in its already-confident responses.  

Novel Architectures
-------------------
`UniversalRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Multiple Corpora with Diverse Modalities and Granularities <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20734>`_
    Existing RAG methods are either limited to a textual corpus, or include only a small number of other modalities.  This paper proposes UniversalRAG, a RAG framework which can contain a wide variety of diverse object types.

`Continuous Thought Machines <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05522>`_
    Sakana AI proposes a novel neural net architecture, the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), which is motivated by the desire to make the function of neural nets more similar to how human brains process information.  CTMs do so by incorporating neuron-level temporal processing and enabling capture of temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable.

`PUZZLE: DISTILLATION-BASED NAS FOR INFERENCE-OPTIMIZED LLMS <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19146>`_
    Presents Puzzle, a framework for LLM inference which operates by utilizing neural architecture search at a large scale.  Given a parent model, Puzzle searches a wide number of architectures to find the optimal one for a given task.

Object Detection
----------------
`LISAT: Language-Instructed Segmentation Assistant for Satellite Imagery <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02829>`_
    Current phrase grounding segmentation capabilities for remote sensing are limited for complex queries.  This paper proposes a new method, LISAT, which can handle queries such as "Locate the truck that is elongated and light-colored, diagonally positioned on the road, contrasting with the surrounding darker pavement."

`Depth Anything with Any Prior <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10565>`_
    Develops a method to combine relative depth maps with depth priors that provide absolute depth information to produce accurate absolute depth estimates from monocular imagery.

Autonomy & Safety
-----------------

    Anthropic's Alignment Science Team investigates whether chain of thought accurately represents a model's reasoning process.  Finds equivocal results: Chain of Though often but not always represents the model's reasoning process, allowing for nontrivial but insufficient monitoring.

`Predicting and explaining AI model performance: A new approach to evaluation <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/predicting-and-explaining-ai-model-performance-a-new-approach-to-evaluation/?msockid=15a11d4c6a9565bf107b0e6b6e956bd2>`_
    Microsoft proposes an evaluation framework for AI models which involves decomposing benchmarks into tasks, grading AI performance according to these tasks to create and ability profile, and using this ability profile to predict future performance.  This benchmarking system generalizes more reliably and provides more fine-grained information than current methods.

`Plasticity as the Mirror of Empowerment <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10361>`_
    Agents have been measured by empowerment: their ability to influence the future.  Equally important, this paper argues, is their plasticity: their ability to be influenced by the past.  This paper identifies and proves that there is a tension between these two foundational abilities.

Reinforcement Learning
----------------------
`Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03335>`_
    Is it possible to develop a reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) training paradigm that uses zero real examples?  To answer, this paper proposes AbsoluteZero, a paradigm where a model (1) proposes tasks to optimize its own learning and (2) learns how to solve these tasks.  Despite using zero real data, models post-trained in this paradigm achieve SOTA results.

`Reinforcement Learning Finetunes Small Subnetworks in Large Language Models <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11711>`_
    A deep dive into the behavior of various reinforcement learning algorithms on improving LLM performance.  Finds that each method of RL updates only a sparse subset of weights; moreover, training only on that sparse subset of weights achieves the same effect as training on the entire network.

`Reinforcement Learning from User Feedback <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14946>`_
    Proposes Reinforcement Learning from User Feedback (RLUF), a generalization of RLHF which aligns LLMs with user preferences by finetuning them with user feedback.

`Spurious Rewards: Rethinking Training Signals in RLVR <https://github.com/ruixin31/Rethink_RLVR/blob/main/paper/rethink-rlvr.pdf?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email>`_
    Demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) induces a performance increase in Qwen models even if there are spurious rewards. No other models exhibit this behavior, and the paper speculates it occurs because the RLVR drives code reasoning.

`Recurrent World Models Facilitate Policy Evolution <https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/2de5d16682c3c35007e4e92982f1a2ba-Paper.pdf>`_

Training & Continuous Learning
------------------------------
`DD-Ranking: Rethinking the Evaluation of Dataset Distillation <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13300>`_
    Dataset distillation methods which involve distilling a large training set into a smaller, synthetic, one for computational purposes have seen advances recently.  However, this paper argues that improved metrics are due to improved techniques applied elsewhere in the training pipeline rather than due to image quality, and proposes a new, fairer, evaluation metric.

`Neural Thermodynamic Laws for Large Language Model Training <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10559>`_
    Introduces a novel framework, neural thermodynamic laws, which characterize the LLM training process using analogies to thermodynamics.  Posits the existence of a river-valley loss landscape, and uses this to recommend training processes.

This paper devises an attack method for differentially private datasets which allows for the guaranteed recovery of some subset of individuals in the dataset.

`Bonsai: Tree representations for distortion-free visualization and exploratory analysis of single-cell omics data <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.08.652944v1.full.pdf>`_
    Proposes Bonsai, an alternative method to t-SNE and UMAP for representing latent structure in high dimensional data.  Bonsai reconstructs a tree relating the high-dimensional data and, among a number of other improvements, is wholly deterministic. 

`Modular Jump Gaussian Processes <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15557>`_
    Jump Gaussian Processes (JGPs) were developed to model processes with sudden, nonstationary, jumps but are difficult to apply in practice.  This paper proposes a new paradigm for JGPs which enables easier inference.

`Random irregular histograms <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22034>`_
    The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment publishes a novel Bayesian approach to irregular histograms which excels at mode detection for larger sample sizes.
