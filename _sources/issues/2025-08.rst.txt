The CoVar Zeitgeist: August, 2025
=================================
A curated list of interesting research papers from the last month. Featuring:

* A method to utilize coresets - high quality subsets of training datasets which are of higher average quality than the entire training set - to improve classification accuracy.
* A Bayesian algorithm which learns a decision-makers implicit utility functions in situations with difficult trade-offs - such as explore-exploit or patient triage - and uses this learned function to assist the decision-maker.
* A paper arguing that agentic benchmarks must possess both task and outcome validity to be useful, and leverages these insights to analyze existing benchmarks.
* A randomized controlled trial from METR which finds that, while software engineers rated themselves as being up to 20% more productive using AI, they were actually 19% less efficient, on average.
* A demonstration of an end-to-end autonomous agent capable of designing, implementing, and testing novel neural architectures which exceed SOTA performance.
* A study from Anthropic showing that, if a teacher and a student model share the same base model, the teacher can transmit traits via data with no apparent relevance to those traits.

`Improving Model Classification by Optimizing the Training Dataset <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16729>`_
    Coresets are subsets of training data sets which allow models trained on them to obtain equivalent performance to models trained on the entire dataset.  This paper explores methods of generating coresets which function for classification accuracy.

`Bayesian preference elicitation for decision support in multi-objective optimization <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16999>`_
    Designs a Bayesian algorithm to estimate the decision-makers utility function from past actions when the user is operating on a Pareto frontier balancing multiple objectives.  Leverages this model to assist with user decision-making.

`Establishing Best Practices for Building Rigorous Agentic Benchmarks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02825>`_
    Argues that many existing agentic benchmarks fail along one of two axes: (1) they evaluate as positive responses which do not truly indicate success, or (2) tasks are solvable if the agents do not possess the target capability.

`Measuring the Impact of Early-2025 AI on Experienced Open-Source Developer Productivity <https://metr.org/Early_2025_AI_Experienced_OS_Devs_Study.pdf>`_
    METR implements a Randomized Controlled Trial to evaluate the effect of AI tool use on software engineers.  Finds that, while software engineers rated themselves as being up to 20% more productive using AI, they were actually 19% less efficient, on average.
    
`AlphaGo Moment for Model Architecture Discovery <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18074>`_
    Develops a novel end-to-end pipeline, ASI-ARCH, for autonomous innovation in designing novel neural architectures.  In experiments, ASI-ARCH autonomously conducted thousands of experiments to discover one hundred novel, SOTA, attention mechanisms.
