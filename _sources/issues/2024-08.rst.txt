`AI achieves silver-medal standard solving International Mathematical Olympiad problems <https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/>`_
    A interesting result from Deepmind: two reinforcement learning algorithms which combine to achieve a silver medal on the problems at this years International Mathematics Olympiad.  Given the replacement-level performance of AI models on math problems, this is astounding.  The authors combined an LLM, the AlphaZero reinforcement learning algorithm, and a formal mathematical prover using formal language that could evaluate whether a given proof was correct: they leveraged the ability to generate solutions with the ability to easily verify whether solutions were correct.

`VILA2 : VILA Augmented VILA <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17453>`_
    A new VLM from NVIDIA.  Of particular interest is the training method, which addressed the problem of running out of labelled quality data.  The authors propose a "self-augment" and a "specialist-augment" step to improve data quality and labels as well as augmenting with other models.  This is an interesting method to generate quality data ex nihilo.

`Revealing the Dark Secrets of Extremely Large Kernel ConvNets on Robustness <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08972>`_
    ConvNets with extremely large kernels achieve comparable/superior performance compared to vision transformers.  This paper demonstrates this for robustness and investigates why.

`Don’t Throw Away Data: Better Sequence Knowledge Distillation <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10456>`_
    From Deepmind.  The problem investigated is how to manage student-teacher cases where you have a big LLM (the teacher) that can perform a specific task (e.g. language translation) but you want a smaller model (the student) to be able to perform the same task.  Finds the most optimal method of teaching the student using the teacher.

`Meta 3D AssetGen: Text-to-Mesh Generation with High-Quality Geometry, Texture, and PBR Materials <https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/meta-3d-assetgen-text-to-mesh-generation-with-high-quality-geometry-texture-and-pbr-materials/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_content=thread&utm_campaign=research>`_
    Meta presents a novel model for generating 3D objects from text or image inputs.  The examples look impressive.  Anyone working on recovering CAD models/3D representations of objects should take a look at this.

    Sony AI trains a sparse 1.16B parameter diffusion transformer over 2.6 days on an 8xH100, with only $1890 in GPU costs.  Lots of effort went into this paper, which shows that small organizations can train comparably large models.

LLMs
----
`Single Character Perturbations Break LLM Alignment <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03232>`_
    LLMs have safeguards built in following directives such as "Don't tell users how to build bombs".  This paper discovered a method to avoid these safeguards by simply by appending a token of whitespace at the end of input prompts.  The authors hypothesize this works because, in training, whitespace prompts the model to make lists and this  association overrides the safeguards.

`On Large Language Models in National Security Applications <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03453>`_
