The CoVar Zeitgeist: November, 2025
=================================
CoVar is pleased to present the CoVar Zeitgeist - our monthly overview of cutting edge-AI/ML.  The November issue covers research from October 2025. Featuring:

* A paper from Meta introducing a novel reinforcement learning framework for language models which maintains positive performance while minimizing hallucinations by encouraging the model to abstain when uncertain.
* A novel random utility model - a correlated probit model - which, when trained on three-tuples of data, can correctly model correlations in user preferences.  This has potential to improve the reward modelling in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.
* A method using multi-agent influence diagrams to target and intervene upon a single agent to affect the desired change in a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework.
* A novel chip architecture, the thermodynamic sampling unit (TSU) which promises to greatly reduce energy expenditure by directly modelling probability distributions on hardware using pbits.
* A novel information-theoretic approach for detecting novel out-of-distribution inputs in image data.
* A paper which (1) establishes an equivalence between different types of AI agents and machines form the Chomsky hierarchy and (2) uses this equivalence to better characterize AI agents.

`TruthRL: Incentivizing Truthful LLMs via Reinforcement Learning <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25760>`_
    Designs a novel training method for LLMs which separately rewards correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions in order to encourage abstaining over hallucinating.  Reduces hallucinations while improving truthfulness.

`Learning Correlated Reward Models: Statistical Barriers and Opportunities <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15839>`_
    The Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption, often made in random utility models (RUM) & reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), collapses all human preferences to a universal utility function.  This paper investigates using a correlated probit model to model RUM instead and finds that, with best-of-three preference data, the IIA assumption can be avoided.

`A Geometric Approach to Optimal Experimental Design <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14848>`_
    Proposes mutual transport dependence, a novel statistical measure of dependence which is more flexible than mutual information and allows grounding in downstream applications.  Leverages this measure to inform experimental design.

`Benchmarking World-Model Learning <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19788>`_
    Creates a test environment for AI agents that learn world models which allows the agents to first learn the world model in an unsupervised phase before being tested on a related challenge.  Models are assessed solely on results, not on internal state activations.

`Stress-Testing Model Specs Reveals Character Differences among Language Models <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07686>`_
    Evaluates how frontier models handle value tradeoffs by presenting them scenarios where they must implicitly choose between different values and assessing their response.

Autonomy
--------
`Agent Learning via Early Experience <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08558>`_
    Proposes a novel paradigm for training agents via reinforcement learning, Early Experience, in domains that lack verifiable rewards, require long time horizons, or are data limited.  Early Experience uses the future world states created by the agent's own early actions to construct a reward signal.

`Are Agents Just Automata? On the Formal Equivalence Between Agentic AI and the Chomsky Hierarchy <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23487>`_

`Semantic Communication with World Models <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24785>`_
    Aims to solve the transmission problem between multiple agents by having each agent employ two modules.  The first is a world foundation model which predicts how the world has developed since the transmission of the last frame, the second is a module which predicts accumulated WFM error and triggers a new frame transmission when necessary.

`Task Completion Agents are not Ideal Collaborators <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25744>`_
    Shows that current agents, which are aimed at one-shot task completion, underperform in scenarios which require collaboration.  Collaborative agents must develop the capability to function in a multi-turn setting, sustain user engagement, and scaffold user understanding.

`The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent’s Safety and Autonomy <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26752>`_
    Proposes a minimal method to train AI agents to be aligned: have a human and the agent play an Oversight game where the human chooses whether to trust or oversee the agent, while the agent chooses to act or defer.  Agents trained in this way learn when to act autonomously and when to defer.

    Constructs a new family of conformal p-values for conformal prediction which are better behaved in the presence of novel test time labels.  

`Learning Correlated Reward Models: Statistical Barriers and Opportunities <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15839>`_
    The Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption, often made in random utility models (RUM) & reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), collapses all human preferences to a universal utility function.

    A paper explaining the methods behind Partial Least Square Regression.

`DepTR-MOT: Unveiling the Potential of Depth-Informed Trajectory Refinement for Multi-Object Tracking <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17323>`_
    Develops a method to improve multi-object tracking by incorporating depth estimates into the pipeline.  Depth estimates are formed first at a frame level by using foundation models, and then distilled into a general depth estimate. Final inference does not rely on foundational models and has low latency which makes it useful for robotics applications.

`Super-Resolution with Structured Motion <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15961>`_
    Develops and experimentally demonstrates super-resolution techniques for motion-blurred images of targets with sparse gradients via classical deconvolution with a motion PSF. Intensity values in motion-blurred images continuously sample over their motion path, so each pixel contains data that can't be resolved by the same detector in a static image. By sampling the lower-resolution image in blocks to match the high-resolution size, and having a precise motion PSF, deblurring and super-resolution can be combined, and iteratively solved with Total Variation (TV) regularized least squares.
