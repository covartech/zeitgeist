The CoVar Zeitgeist: February, 2026
===================================
This issue of the CoVar Zeitgeist predominantly features research from January, 2026.  The Vice President of Cohere AI published an interesting position paper this month which argues that further increasing scaling is unlikely to lead to corresponding increases in performance.  This is still a controversial opinion, but consistent with other recent research, including innovations in LLM architecture from frontier labs seeking performance gains instead of simply increasing scaling and measure of how useful datasets are for fixed compute budgets.  Non-LLM research saw an increasing number of papers in 3D scene reconstruction and a focus on how best to utilize autonomous agents. We feature six papers:

* A new language model architecture from DeepSeek which incorporates n-grams to store common multi-token phrases, alleviating the need to recompute such phrases and increasing the effective depth of the network.
* A novel information theoretic measure, epiplexity, which measures the amount of information an agent with a set compute budget can learn from a dataset.
* A trilogy of papers arguing that transformers naturally speak the language of Bayesian inference due to the nature of the attention training mechanism under cross-entropy loss.
* A novel reinforcement learning method which incorporates a swam-based exploration layer to increase performance.
* A new setup for scientific discovery agents which optimizes reward function design and optimizes to said reward function simultaneously.
* An extension of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to a multi-context setting.

--------
`Conditional Memory via Scalable Lookup: A New Axis of Sparsity for Large Language Models <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Engram/blob/main/Engram_paper.pdf>`_
    Argues that the transformer architecture forces LLMs to derive known concepts such as multi-token phrases through brute force computation rather than retrieval, wasting valuable layers of the network. To remedy this, proposes a module named Engram which modernizes N-gram structures and greatly outperforms existing Mixture-of-Expert architectures.

`From Entropy to Epiplexity: Rethinking Information for Computationally Bounded Intelligence <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03220>`_
    Creates Epiplexity, an information-theoretic measure for measuring predictable structured information an observer with a set amount of compute can learn from a dataset.  Argues that epiplexity, rather than entropy, is the relevant measure for selecting datasets to train frontier models.

`Attention Is Bayesian Inference <https://medium.com/@vishalmisra/attention-is-bayesian-inference-578c25db4501>`_
    A trilogy of papers arguing that Bayesian Inference is the natural language of transformers.  Shows that the hierarchical attention mechanism, when trained with stochastic gradient descent and cross-entropy loss, forces a two-stage updating process similar to the EM algorithm.  This causes Bayesian submanifolds to form, enabling transformers to naturally perform Bayesian inference.

`ARISE: Adaptive Reinforcement Integrated with Swarm Exploration <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00693>`_
    Proposes a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, ARISE, which utilizes a particle swarm-based method to better explore the action space for an agent.  Agents trained with ARISE better withstand reward fluctuations, demonstrating better potential for generalization.

`Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Autonomous Goal-evolving Agents <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21782>`_
    Proposes an AI agent for scientific discovery with two loops; the outer loop optimizes reward function design, while the inner loop optimizes to that reward function.  Mitigates reward hacking and improves performance.

    Extends PCA to a multiple context setting with multi-context PCA (MCPCA).  MCPCA decomposes multi-context data into axes which explain subsets of contexts and finds factors explaining the data which elude existing methods.
