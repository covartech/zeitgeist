--------
`Scanning Trojaned Models Using Out-of-Distribution Samples <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17151>`_
    Neural nets with trojans tend to blind spots on their decision boundary.  This paper leverages this insight to build a black box detection scheme for trojans in a neural net by noting when out-of-distribution samples are incorrectly classified as in-distribution.  Code is available.  

`GROKKING AT THE EDGE OF NUMERICAL STABILITY <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04697>`_
    Why does grokking only occur in the presence of regularization?  This paper finds that regularization is necessary to avoid softmax collapse, a troubling phenomena involving floating points errors in the softmax function.  Mitigating softmax collapse leads to grokking without regularization.

`The GAN is dead; long live the GAN! A Modern Baseline GAN <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05441>`_
    Proposes a novel training paradigm for GANs that solves many of the reliability issues faced by traditional methods by using a well-behaved loss function.  Achieves SOTA performance.  Code available.

`Over-Tokenized Transformer: Vocabulary is Generally Worth Scaling <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16975>`_
    Decouples input and output tokenizations in LLMs to investigate the effects of token scaling.  Finds a log-linear relationship between input size and training loss, implying that smaller architectures can achieve the same performance as larger ones by increasing vocabulary size.

`ALIGNMENT FAKING IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14093>`_
    Demonstrates that LLMs can engage in "alignment faking": an LLM can limit itself to good responses when it thinks it is in training while not limiting itself when it believes itself to be outside its training environment.

`DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948>`_
    DeepSeek discusses their approach to LLM reasoning: let them think for a bit, trains them to think give them accuracy awards, and format rewards.  Effective for paradigms with "correct answers" such as math and logic.

LLMs
----
`MONTY HALL AND OPTIMIZED CONFORMAL PREDICTION TO IMPROVE DECISION-MAKING WITH LLMS <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00555>`_
    Proposes a novel conformal prediction method inspired by the Monty Hall problem which improves LLM performance on multiple choice questions.  The set of multiple choice questions is reduced to the set indicated by conformal prediction, and the LLM is reprompted on the new, smaller set.  Improves performance compared to SOTA.

`Beyond Reward Hacking: Causal Rewards for Large Language Model Alignment <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09620>`_
    RLHF can drive an LLM to earn spurious correlations and so drive a number of undesirable biases.  This paper proposes a causal reward model to avoid spurious correlations and so avoid reward hacking.

`MONA: Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval Can Mitigate Multi-step Reward Hacking <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13011>`_
    Proposes an optimizer, MONA, for use in RLHF which reduces reward-hacking behavior by the LLM.  MONA works by combining short-term optimization and long-term reward.

`Over-Tokenized Transformer: Vocabulary is Generally Worth Scaling <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16975>`_
    Decouples input and output tokenizations in LLMs to investigate the effects of token scaling.  Finds a log-linear relationship between input size and training loss, implying that smaller architectures can achieve the same performance as larger ones by increasing vocabulary size.

`CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF LLM UNLEARNING VIA QUANTIZATION <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16454>`_
    Finds that trying to “unlearn” things through additional training or RLHF is actually more like learning the censoring. If you quantize the model, you can actually end up forgetting the censoring, thus restoring the knowledge.

`ALIGNMENT FAKING IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14093>`_
    Demonstrates that LLMs can engage in "alignment faking": an LLM can limit itself to good responses when it thinks it is in training while not limiting itself when it believes itself to be outside its training environment.

`Virgo: A Preliminary Exploration on Reproducing o1-like MLLM <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01904>`_
    Explores how best to add slow-thinking reasoning capabilities to VLMs.  Finds that the best way is to fine-tune the VLM with long-form textual thought data rather than visual data.

`Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00663v1>`_
    Attention functions as short term memory in transformers.  This paper proposes a novel memory unit, called neural memory, which is itself trained and functions as a long term memory.  Combining attention and neural memory into one architecture results in the Titan architecture, which can effectively scale to larger than 2M token context windows.

`TRANSFORMER2: SELF-ADAPTIVE LLMS <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06252>`_
