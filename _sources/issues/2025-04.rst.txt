The CoVar Zeitgeist: April, 2025
================================
There is a lot of interesting research this month. Featuring:

* A paper describing non-linear transforms based on optimal transport which can be used for classification, estimation, and reconstruction problems.
* An implementation of tracking algorithms in a setting where there is genuine irreducible frame-to-frame uncertainty, cell tracking.
* A really cool paper from Google about combining Neural Cellular Automata and Differentiable Logic Gates to learn local rules which, when implemented in a setting similar to Conway’s game of life, can recreate desired patterns.
* A statistical method to estimate how much of the uncertainty in your model is from genuine noise in the data and how much comes from the model.
* A demonstration that middle layers of a neural net may be used to define outputs better than the final layers.
* A deep dive into the "thinking" of an LLM which, among other things, demonstrates that it plans ahead more than one token when writing poetry.

`Data representation with optimal transport <https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15503>`_
    Describes a family of non-linear transforms based on optimal transport (OT). Such transforms applied to signals can help solve classification, estimation, and reconstruction problems.

`How To Make Your Cell Tracker Say “I dunno!” <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09244>`_
    Discusses how to implement tracking in a paradigm where there is genuine uncertainty about how detections should be assigned to tracks: tracking cells in live-cell microscopy.  Proposes two solutions: a Bayesian tracking methodology and classification-based tracking methodology.  Methods could be adapted for other low-framerate applications.

`Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata <https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/?hn>`_
    Researchers combine Neural Cellular Automata and Differentiable Logic Gates to learn local rules which, when implemented in a setting similar to Conway's game of life, can recreate desired patterns.  Worth a read.

`Do You Understand Epistemic Uncertainty? Think Again! Rigorous Frequentist Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation in Regression <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13317>`_
    Model uncertainty can arise from two sources of noise: underlying irreducible noise in the data and model uncertainty.  This paper proposes a method to measure the second by having a model double-guess its own output and measuring how sure it is.

`Layer by Layer: Uncovering Hidden Representations in Language Models <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02013>`_
    Traditionally, the last layers of LLMs have been used to define outputs.  However, this paper shows that earlier layers can encode richer representations than outer layers, and demonstrates why.

`Tracing the thoughts of a large language model <https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model?utm_source=www.therundown.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=openai-nears-record-funding-round&_bhlid=4c0bce5ba4bff771ed63a8fe44a5527656a6548e>`_
    Anthropic does a deep dive into the inner workings of their premier LLM, Claude, to analyze how it thinks. Finds a "conceptual space" that is shared between languages, evidence that Claude thinks multiple words ahead instead of just one token ahead, and that Claude will sometimes engage in motivated reason when prompted by the user.

LLMs
----
`Forecasting Rare Language Model Behaviors <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16797>`_
    Some risks with LLMs are rare and emerge only at scale.  This paper fits a model to find the probability that a query will return an undesirable result, at scale, and verifies its efficacy in production.

`Layer by Layer: Uncovering Hidden Representations in Language Models <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02013>`_
    Traditionally, the last layers of LLMs have been used to define outputs.  However, this paper shows that earlier layers can encode richer representations than outer layers, and demonstrates why.

`Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14499>`_
    Proposes a new method for LLM evaluation, "how long does it take a human to complete a task that an LLM can complete with at least 50% accuracy".  Uses this to evaluate LLM performance over time, finding that, according to this metric, LLM performance has been doubling every 7 months for the last 6 years.

`Inside-Out: Hidden Factual Knowledge in LLMs <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15299>`_
    Proposes a definition of knowledge, and develops a method of querying LLMs to ascertain whether LLMs know knowledge but will not communicate it.  Finds that LLMs often know things perfectly, but do not include such knowledge in responses.  This places theoretical limits on what can be gleaned from scaling test-time compute.

    Finds that directly optimizing Chain of Thought to follow specific behaviors (e.g., "don't think about elephants") may cause a model to hide its intent rather than eliminate the undesired behavior.  Advocates for leaving CoT uncensored, to better monitor model behavior.  

`AUDITING LANGUAGE MODELS FOR HIDDEN OBJECTIVES <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10965>`_
    Conducts a study of whether a blue team can deduce a hidden objective which has been placed inside an LLM pre-trained to fool reward modellers in RLHF.  Three out of four blue teams successfully found the hidden objective.

`EconEvals: Benchmarks and Litmus Tests for LLM Agents in Unknown Environments <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18825>`_
    Seeks to score LLM agent behavior in a variety of economic settings, with a focus on measuring how well LLMs can optimize.  Introduces the concept of litmus score which, rather than measure how "correct" an LLM's choice is, instead measures how it tends to behave when confronted with tradeoffs. 

Reinforcement Learning
----------------------
`All Roads Lead to Likelihood: The Value of Reinforcement Learning in Fine-Tuning <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01067>`_
    Why do frontier models complete their post-training with a complicated two-stage reinforcement learning procedure rather than directly optimizing parameters? This paper investigates, and finds that increased performance derives from searching over policies which are easy to verify.

`DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14476>`_

`What Makes a Reward Model a Good Teacher? An Optimization Perspective <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15477>`_
    Examines reward model dynamics in RLHF.  Finds that reward policies, even accurate ones, can induce slow optimization if they induce low reward variance.  Moreover, reward model variance can shift between language models, indicating that the optimal reward model depends on the model being trained.

`Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training: A Critical Perspective <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20783>`_
    Investigates the driving force behind the performance of R1-like models by investigating the base model and the reinforcement learning at scale processes separately.  Finds a bias in the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) which encourages long responses for incorrect answer, and proposes a modified method, Dr. GRPO, to fix this.

Theory
------
`A Little Depth Goes a Long Way: The Expressive Power of Log-Depth Transformers <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03961>`_
    Transformers struggle with sequential reasoning problems with long input lengths, because their computational depth is bounded.  This paper derives theoretical scaling laws for depth in transformers, and finds that it matches practical results.

`When Do Transformers Outperform Feedforward and Recurrent Networks? A Statistical Perspective <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11272>`_
    Proves via a statistical analysis that, even without infinite compute, transformers are more efficient than feed-forward and recurrent neural networks because a sufficient number of attention heads let it implement dynamic sparsity.

`Do You Understand Epistemic Uncertainty? Think Again! Rigorous Frequentist Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation in Regression <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13317>`_
    Model uncertainty can arise from two sources of noise: underlying irreducible noise in the data and model uncertainty.  This paper proposes a method to measure the second by having a model double-guess its own output and measuring how sure it is.
