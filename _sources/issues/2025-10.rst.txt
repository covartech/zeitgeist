Featured
--------
`Why Language Models Hallucinate <https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/>`_
    Argues that hallucinations arise in LLMs because the training and evaluation pipelines reward correct answers only: LLMs are incentivized to make confident, if often incorrect guesses rather than abstaining when unsure.  By restructuring these processes hallucinations can be reduced.

`An AI system to help scientists write expert-level empirical software <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06503>`_
    Designs an AI system that leverages LLMs and Tree Search to design software to maximize a quality metric.  Uses this system to discover a plethora of SOTA techniques across a wide variety of fields.  
    
`AbideGym: Turning Static RL Worlds into Adaptive Challenges <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21234>`_
    Agents trained with static environments fail when environments change.  This paper proposes more robust RL training including perturbations and scaleable complexity to overcome this limitation.

`DepTR-MOT: Unveiling the Potential of Depth-Informed Trajectory Refinement for Multi-Object Tracking <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17323>`_
    Develops a method to improve multi-object tracking by incorporating depth estimates into the pipeline.  Depth estimates are formed first at a frame level by using foundation models, and then distilled into a general depth estimate.

`On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21038>`_
    Proves a theoretical limit of embedding-based document retrieval: the ability of systems to successfully return top-k lists of documents is limited by the embedding dimension.  Demonstrates  this on a real-world dataset.

`Global-Local Dirichlet Processes for Identifying Pan-Cancer Subpopulations Using Both Shared and Cancer-Specific Data <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22884>`_
    Proposes the Global-Local Dirichlet Process, a Bayesian nonparametric clustering method for clustering datapoints across groups where (1) all datapoints share a common set of covariates and (2) each group has its own, specific, set of covariates.

LLMs
----
`Why Language Models Hallucinate <https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/>`_
    Argues that hallucinations arise in LLMs because the training and evaluation pipelines reward correct answers only: LLMs are incentivized to make confident, if often incorrect guesses rather than abstaining when unsure.  By restructuring these processes hallucinations can be reduced.

`Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference <https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference/#conclusion-2-2>`_
    A detailed analysis on the causes of nondeterminism in LLMs.  Argues that a large part of the cause is that CPU/GPU/TPU kernels are nondeterministic with respect to batch size.  Proposes a novel computational method which ensures that LLMs prompted with the same prompt at zero temperature generate the same output. 

`Speculative cascades â€” A hybrid approach for smarter, faster LLM inference <https://research.google/blog/speculative-cascades-a-hybrid-approach-for-smarter-faster-llm-inference/>`_
    Google combines two existing methodologies for LLM inference - cascades, where a small LLM answers what it can and defers what it cannot to a larger LLM, and speculative decoding, which uses a small LLM to draft and a large LLM to verify - into one method, speculative cascades.  The new method generates better output at a lower cost than either of its substituent methods.

-------------
