--------
`The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity <https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking>`_
    Apple investigates Large Reasoning Model (LRM) and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities by constructing sequences of puzzles which increase complexity while maintaining the same underlying logical patterns.  Finds that LLMs outperform LRMs for low complexity tasks, LRMs outperform LLMs for medium complexity tasks, and that both collapse after a certain complexity threshold.  

`From Bytes to Ideas: Language Modeling with Autoregressive U-Nets <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14761>`_
    Existing tokenization schemes split text into tokens and leave models with that tokenization scheme.  This paper proposes using an autoregressive U-Net to embed tokens during training.  This results in a network where shallow layers focus on fine-grained byte-level tokens and deeper levels deal with semantic concepts.
    
`The Emergence of Abstract Thought in Large Language Models Beyond Any Language <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09890>`_
    Finds that LLMs, even though trained on language data, develop a core set of neurons that are language agnostic and support much of the model's capability.  Moreover, the size of this set of neurons has grown over time, indicating that LLMs are developing capabilities in some other latent space.

`Embodied AI Agents: Modeling the World <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22355>`_
    Meta AI Research reflects on an impressive amount of experience building and designing a variety of embodied AI agents: wearable devices, virtual avatars, and robotics.  Argues that embodied agents need (1) physical world models to understand the world and formulate plans and (2) mental world models to interact effectively with humans.

`ARMOR: Robust Reinforcement Learning-based Control for UAVs under Physical Attacks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22423>`_
    Proposes a novel two-stage reinforcement learning algorithm, ARMOR, to allow a UAV to function properly while subjected to adverse-sensor manipulation attacks such as GPS spoofing.  ARMOR allows the UAV to approximate its physical state vector as a function of only onboard sensors.
    
`Mixtures of Neural Cellular Automata: A Stochastic Framework for Growth Modelling and Self-Organization <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20486>`_
    One limitation of traditional neural cellular automata (NCA) models is that, because of their deterministic nature, they can fail to capture real-world stochasticity.  To address this limitation, this paper introduces mixtures of NCAs (MNCAs) which are better equipped to handle stochasticity.

LLMs
----
`How much do language models memorize? <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24832>`_
    Splits LLM memorization into two parts: (1) unintended memorization and (2) generalization.  Finds that grokking occurs when model capacity saturates and LLMs devote less resources to unintended memorization and more to generalization.

`The Geometries of Truth Are Orthogonal Across Tasks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08572>`_
    Can a linear classifier, applied to the internal dynamics of an LLM, predict whether LLM responses are truthful?  This paper finds that the answer is no, in part because truth is defined on a per-task level and that classifiers trained across tasks have little in common.

`The Emergence of Abstract Thought in Large Language Models Beyond Any Language <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09890>`_
    Finds that LLMs, even though trained on language data, develop a core set of neurons that are language agnostic and support much of the model's capability.  Moreover, the size of this set of neurons has grown over time, indicating that LLMs are developing capabilities in some other latent space.

`Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15679>`_
    Applying Semantic Auto Encoders (SAEs) to LLMs has resulted in a nontrivial amount of dense latents, which have been suspected to be meaningless and result from noise.  This paper investigates dense latents and finds that they result from the residual space, have meaningful roles, and should not be dismissed.

`Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872>`_
    Researchers from MIT comprehensively evaluate the effects of LLM useage on brain activity and learning when students are asked to write essays.  They find that using LLMs greatly degrades learning.

LLM Reasoning
-------------
`The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity <https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking>`_
    Apple investigates Large Reasoning Model (LRM) and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities by constructing sequences of puzzles which increase complexity while maintaining the same underlying logical patterns.  Finds that LLMs outperform LRMs for low complexity tasks, LRMs outperform LLMs for medium complexity tasks, and that both collapse after a certain complexity threshold.  

`AbstentionBench: Reasoning LLMs Fail on Unanswerable Questions <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09038>`_
    For an LLM to be reliable, it must be able to abstain from answering unanswerable questions.  This paper introduces a dataset to test this capability, and finds that current frontier reasoning LLMs struggle to abstain and that finetuning for reasoning capabilities actually degrades performance.

Novel Architectures
-------------------

`From Bytes to Ideas: Language Modeling with Autoregressive U-Nets <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14761>`_

    The Qwen team investigates how RLVR interacts with Qwen.  Finds that a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy in Chain-of-Thought patterns and that RLVR modifies primarily those tokens: RLVR can be improved by restricting it to high entropy tokens.

Statistics
----------
`The Resurrection of the ReLU <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22074>`_
    ReLU has been an effective activation function, but suffers from the dying ReLU problem where neurons become irreversibly inactive.  This paper proposes surrogate gradient learning for ReLU (SUGAR) which adds a smooth surrogate to the ReLU's derivative in the backwards pass which avoids zeroing out neurons.

    Highlights that the Gittins index can be used as a tool to provide extremely good solutions to multi-armed bandit problems and the explore-exploit dilemma.  Formalizes the index in terms of Markov Decision Processes.

`Do more observations bring more information in rare events? <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13671>`_
    Demonstrates that increasing sample size does not increase statistical power for rare events; instead, power for rare events depends on the number of rare events which occur.  Proposes new methodologies and proves effectiveness accounting for this phenomena.
