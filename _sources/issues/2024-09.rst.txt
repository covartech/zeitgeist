The CoVar Zeitgeist: September, 2024
====================================
There is a lot of interesting research this month. Featuring:

* An overview of ML techniques in non-Euclidean spaces. 
* IBM gets LLMs to code reliably with "100%" success.
* A new way LLMs can go horribly wrong.  If you tell an LLM that Kenny likes the color yellow and then ask it what Kennyâ€™s job is, it will say that Kenny is a school bus driver because school busses are yellow.
* A method of analyzing deep neural nets with spectral weights.  Can distinguish between several classes of neural nets (e.g. "memorizing" or "generalizing").
* How to use the least amount amount of human to get your computer to recognize when it's dealing with out-of-distribution data
* Can it run Doom?  A neural net can!  No word on Crysis.
