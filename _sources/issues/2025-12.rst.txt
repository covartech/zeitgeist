The CoVar Zeitgeist: December, 2025
=================================
There were many interesting papers published in November. Featuring:

* A post-hoc calibration method for multi-class deep neural network detectors & classifiers which leverages the quadratic softmax.
* A method for out-of-distribution object detection in deep neural networks based on geometric properties of the network's penultimate layer.

Featured
--------
`Structured Matrix Scaling for Multi-Class Calibration <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03685>`_
    Analyzes post-hoc recalibration methods for deep CNN detectors/classifiers from a theoretical perspective and argues that the quadratic softmax model enjoys theoretical properties lacking in other methods.

`Perturbations in the Orthogonal Complement Subspace for Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00849>`_
    Observes that in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data are geometrically distinguished in the penultimate layer of a neural network because ID data lives in a dominant principal subspace and OOD data lives in the complement to this subspace.  Proposes an algorithm to distinguish between the two based on this fact.

`Superhuman AI for Stratego Using Self-Play Reinforcement Learning and Test-Time Search <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07312>`_
    Researchers funded by the Office of Naval Research introduce the first (super) human level AI agent for Stratego, Ataraxos, which cost only a few thousand dollars to train with a novel self-play reinforcement learning process.  This demonstrates that AI agents can be trained to make optimal strategic decisions in imperfect information environments.

`Souper-Model: How Simple Arithmetic Unlocks State-of-the-Art LLM Performance <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13254>`_
    Develops a method to find the optimal way to soup models together by analyzing component model performance across a set of benchmarks.  The resulting souped model outperforms its component models.

`Know Your Limits: Entropy Estimation Modeling for Compression and Generalization <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10618>`_
    Posits that there exists some entropy bound on how much language can compress.  Obtains per-token entropy estimates and uses these to show that models trained to approach the entropy of their training data generalize better than other models.

`Understanding neural networks through sparse circuits <https://openai.com/index/understanding-neural-networks-through-sparse-circuits/>`_
    Creates a novel class of architecture which encourages sparse circuits where each neuron is connected to only dozens of other neurons by encouraging the vast majority of model weights to be zero.  This class of models is much more amenable to mechanistic interpretability.

LLMs
----
`The Smol Training Playbook: The Secrets to Building World-Class LLMs <https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceTB/smol-training-playbook#introduction>`_
    Huggingface writes a detailed description of the process of training a world-class LLM from the SmolLM family.  Worth a read.

Finds mixed results, with generally more capable models generally performing better.

`Context Rot: How Increasing Input Tokens Impacts LLM Performance <https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot>`_
    Conducts an in-depth study to show that frontier models suffer large performance decreases with increasing context size.  Demonstrates this with needle in a haystack (NIAH) problems of increasing complexity.

`LLM Output Drift: Cross-Provider Validation & Mitigation for Financial Workflows <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07585>`_
    Analyzes how to force an LLM to always return the same response to the same query.  Finds that small models can be forced to be 100% reliable, but large models always exhibit some inconsistency.

`From shortcuts to sabotage: natural emergent misalignment from reward hacking <https://www.anthropic.com/research/emergent-misalignment-reward-hacking>`_
    Finds that LLMs which learn to reward hack when they're not supposed to also simultaneously become misaligned.  This behavior goes away if the LLM is explicitly allowed to reward hack.

Autonomy
--------
`Agents Rule of Two: A Practical Approach to AI Agent Security <https://ai.meta.com/blog/practical-ai-agent-security/>`_
    Meta proposes that, in order for an AI agent to be considered secure to prompt injections, it must have no more than two of three of the following capabilities: (1) can process untrustworthy inputs, (2) can access sensitive information/systems, and (3) can affect changes or communicate to the outside world.  An agent which requires all three cannot be trusted to operate without human supervision.
