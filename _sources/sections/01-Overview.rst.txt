Overview

CoVar is an applied technology company that needs to stay informed about the state of the art in technology. This includes anything from fundamental AI research, to new processor designs, to a new javascript library. There is a lot of information to find, read, understand and synthesize. Is this useful? Is this useful for CoVar? Is this an indicator of an interesting direction?

The CoVar Readers' Digest is an approach to distribute this monumental task. A team of contributors collect their thoughts on a monthly basis and publish a report of bite-sized micro-summaries of interesting things they have found. If you are interested in contributing contact Kenny.
